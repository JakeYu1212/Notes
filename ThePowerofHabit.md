## PART ONE The Habits of Individuals

### PROLOGUE The Habit Cure

"All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits," William James wrote in 1892. Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of well-considered decision making, but they're not. They're habits.

more than 40 percent of the actions people performed each day weren't actual decisions, but habits.

Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.

It focuses on habits as they are technically defined: the choices that all of us deliberatelyy make at some point, and then stop thinking about but continue doing, often every day.

Create triggers to make it a routine.

there's nothing you can't do if you get the habits right.

### 1. The Habit Loop - How Habits Work

Squire's studies would show that even someone who can't remember his own age or almost anything else can develop habits that seem inconceivably complex — until you realize that everyone relies on similar neurological processes every day.

Why does my brain decide that one memory is more important than another?

When you dream up a new invention or laugh at a friend's joke, it's the outside parts of your brain at work. That's where the most complex thinking occurs.

As each rat learned how to navigate the maze, its mental activity decreased. As the route became more and more automatic, each rat started thinking less and less.

Within a week, even the brain structures related to memory had quieted. The rat had internalized how to sprint through the maze to such a degree that it hardly needed to think at all.

But the internalization—run straight, hang a left, eat the chocolate—relied upon the basal ganglia, the brain probe indicated.

The basal ganglia was central to recalling patterns and acting on them. The basal ganglia, in other words, stored habits even while the rest of the brain went to sleep.

Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort.

First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for future.

**cue, routine, reward—becomes more and more automatic.**

When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making.

The problem is that your brain can't tell the difference between bad and good habits, and so if you have a bad one, it's always lurking there, waitin for the right cues and rewards.

Habits are often as much a curse as a benefit.

We might not remember the experiences that create our habits, but once they are lodged within our brains they influence how we act — often without our realization.

Habits are powerful, but delicate.

They(habits) shape our lives far more than we realize — they are so strong, in fact, that they cause our brains to cling to them at the exclusion of all else, including common sense.

**By learning to observe the cues and rewards, though, we can change the routines.**

### 2. The Craving Brain - How to Create New Habits

Throughout his career, one of Claude Hopkins's signature tactics was to *find simple triggers to convince consumers to use his products every day.*

The psychology was grounded in two basic rules: 

First, find a simple and obvious cue.

Second, clearly define the rewards.

Studies of people who have successfully started new exercise routines, for instance, show they are more likely to stick with a workout plan if they choose **a specific cue**, such as running as soon as they get home from work, and **a clear reward**, such as a beer or an evening of guilt-free television.

This explains why habits are so powerful: They create neurological cravings.

The habit loop is spinning because a sense of craving has emerged.

Once that craving exists, Julio will act automatically… This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then <font color=FF0000>**cultivating a craving that drives the loop. **</font>

**<font color = #FF0000>If you want to start running each morning, it's essential that you choose a simple cure (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (such as a midday treat, a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog.</font>**

**<font color = #FF0000>Only when your brain starts expecting the reward — craving the endorphins or sense of accomplishment — will it become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come.</font>**

Consumers need some kind of signal that a product is working … as long as it has a cool tingle, people feel like their mouth is clean. The tingling doesn't make the toothpaste work any better. It just convinces people it's doing the job.
