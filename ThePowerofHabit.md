## PART ONE The Habits of Individuals

### PROLOGUE The Habit Cure

"All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits," William James wrote in 1892. Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of well-considered decision making, but they're not. They're habits.

more than 40 percent of the actions people performed each day weren't actual decisions, but habits.

Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.

It focuses on habits as they are technically defined: the choices that all of us deliberatelyy make at some point, and then stop thinking about but continue doing, often every day.

Create triggers to make it a routine.

there's nothing you can't do if you get the habits right.

### 1. The Habit Loop - How Habits Work

Squire's studies would show that even someone who can't remember his own age or almost anything else can develop habits that seem inconceivably complex — until you realize that everyone relies on similar neurological processes every day.

Why does my brain decide that one memory is more important than another?

When you dream up a new invention or laugh at a friend's joke, it's the outside parts of your brain at work. That's where the most complex thinking occurs.

As each rat learned how to navigate the maze, its mental activity decreased. As the route became more and more automatic, each rat started thinking less and less.

Within a week, even the brain structures related to memory had quieted. The rat had internalized how to sprint through the maze to such a degree that it hardly needed to think at all.

But the internalization—run straight, hang a left, eat the chocolate—relied upon the basal ganglia, the brain probe indicated.

The basal ganglia was central to recalling patterns and acting on them. The basal ganglia, in other words, stored habits even while the rest of the brain went to sleep.

Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort.

First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for future.

**cue, routine, reward—becomes more and more automatic.**

When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making.

The problem is that your brain can't tell the difference between bad and good habits, and so if you have a bad one, it's always lurking there, waitin for the right cues and rewards.

Habits are often as much a curse as a benefit.

We might not remember the experiences that create our habits, but once they are lodged within our brains they influence how we act — often without our realization.

Habits are powerful, but delicate.

They(habits) shape our lives far more than we realize — they are so strong, in fact, that they cause our brains to cling to them at the exclusion of all else, including common sense.

**By learning to observe the cues and rewards, though, we can change the routines.**

### 2. The Craving Brain - How to Create New Habits

Throughout his career, one of Claude Hopkins's signature tactics was to *find simple triggers to convince consumers to use his products every day.*

The psychology was grounded in two basic rules: 

First, find a simple and obvious cue.

Second, clearly define the rewards.

Studies of people who have successfully started new exercise routines, for instance, show they are more likely to stick with a workout plan if they choose **a specific cue**, such as running as soon as they get home from work, and **a clear reward**, such as a beer or an evening of guilt-free television.

This explains why habits are so powerful: They create neurological cravings.

The habit loop is spinning because a sense of craving has emerged.

Once that craving exists, Julio will act automatically… This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then **<font color=FF0000>cultivating a craving that drives the loop. </font>**

**<font color = #FF0000>If you want to start running each morning, it's essential that you choose a simple cure (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (such as a midday treat, a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog.</font>**

**<font color = #FF0000>Only when your brain starts expecting the reward — craving the endorphins or sense of accomplishment — will it become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come.</font>**

Consumers need some kind of signal that a product is working … as long as it has a cool tingle, people feel like their mouth is clean. The tingling doesn't make the toothpaste work any better. It just convinces people it's doing the job.

Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier.

### 3. The Golden Rule of Habit Change - Why Transformation  Occurs

"Champions don't do extraordinary things," Dungy would explain. "They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team to react. They follow the habits they've learned."

Dungy recognized that you can never truly extinguish bad habits. Rather, to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine.

How it works: Use the same cue. Provide the same reward. Change the routine.

But to change an old habit, you must address an old craving. You have to keep the same cues and rewards as before, and feed the craving by inserting a new routine.

**They picked up a bottle because that's how they automatically dealt with anxiety.**

The alcoholics only permanently changed once they learned new routines that drew on the old triggers and provided a familiar relief.

The truth is, the brain can be reprogrammed. You just have to be deliberate about it.

Often, we don't really understand the cravings driving our behaviors until we look for them.

It was belief itself that made a difference. Once people learned how to believe in something, that skill started spilling over to other parts of their lives, until they started believing they could change.

…"but belief seems critical. You don't have to believe in God, but you do need the capacity to believe that things will get better."

**What can make a difference is *believing* that they can cope with that stress without alcohol **

We know that a habit cannot be eradicated — it must, instead, be replaced.

we crave a cigarette at breakfast a month later not because we physically need it, but because we remember so fondly the rush it once provided each morning.

Much of the time, those changes are accomplished because people examine the cues, cravings, and rewards that drive their behaviors and then find ways to replace their self-destructive routines with healthier alternatives, even if they aren't fully aware of what they are doing at the time.

## PART TWO The Habits of Successful Organizations

### 4. Keystone habits, or the Ballad of Paul O'Neil - Which Habits Matter Most

"I knew I had to transform Alcoa," O'Neil told me. "But you can't order people to change. That's not how the brain works. So I decided I was going to start by focusing on one thing. If I could start disrupting the habits around one thing, it would spread throughout the entire company."

Keystone habits start a process that, over time, transforms everything.

Keystone habits say that success doesn't depend on getting every single thing right, but instead relies on identifying a few key priorities and fashioning them into powerful levers.

We were basically ceding decision making to a process that occurred without actually thinking.

The best agencies understood the importance of routines. The worst agencies were headed by people who never thought about it, and then wondered why no one followed their orders.

studies from the past decade examining the impacts of exercise on daily routines. When people start habitually exercising, even as infrequently as once a week, they start changing other, unrelated patterns in their lives, often unknowingly … But for many people, exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change. "Exercise spills over," said James Prochaska, a University of Rhode Island researcher. "There's something about it that makes other good habits easier."

Detecting keystone habits means searching out **certain characteristics**. Keystone habits offer what is known within academic literature as "small wins." They help other habits to flourish by creating new structures, and they establish cultures where change becomes contagious.

crossing the gap between understanding those principles and using them requires a bit of ingenuity.

All he need to do was target a few specific habits that had nothing to do with swimming and everything to do with creating the right **mind-set**.

"Small wins are a steady application of a small advantage," one Cornell professor wrote in 1984. "Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are ste in motion that favor another small win." Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.

concentrate on these tiny moments of success and build them into mental triggers.

by creating structures that help other habits to flourish.

This is the final way that keystone habits encourage widespread change: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained.

Cultures grow out of the keystone habits in every organization, whether leaders are aware of them or not.

Keystone habits transform us by creating cultures that make clear the values that, in the heat of a difficult decision or a moment of uncertainty, we might otherwise forget.

### 5. Starbucks and the Habit of Success - When Willpower Becomes Automatic

Dozens of studies show that willpower is the single most important keystone habits for individual success.

Sometimes it looks like people with great self-control aren't working hard — but that's because they've made it automatic … Their will power occur without them having to think about it.

Willpower isn't just a skill. It's a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there's less power left over for other things.

The more time they spent at the gym, the fewer cigarettes they smoked and the less alcohol, caffeine, and junk food they consumed. They were spending more hours on homework and fewer watching TV. They were less depressed.

As people strengthed their willpower muscles in one part of their lives — in the gym, or a money management program — that strength spilled over into what they ate or how hard they worked. Once willpower became stronger, it touched everything.

This is how willpower becomes a habit: by choosing a certain behavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inflection point arrives.

"I've been really lucky," he said. "And I really, genuinely believe that if you tell people that they have what it takes to succeed, they'll prove you right."

When people are asked to do something that takes self-control, if they think they are doing it for personal reasons — if they feel like it's a choice or something they enjoy because it helps someone else — it's much less taxing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, if they're just following orders, their willpower muscles get tired much faster.

Simply giving employees a sense of agency — a feeling that they are in control, that they have genuine decision-making authority — can radically increase how much energy and focus they bring to their jobs.

Giving employees a sense of control improved how much self-discipline they brought to their jobs.

People want to be in control of their lives.

### 6. The Power of a Crisis - How Leaders Create Habits Throught Accident and Design

Just as choosing the right keystone habits can create amazing change, the wrong ones can create disasters.

Destructive organizational habits can be found within hundreds of industries and at thousands of firms. And almost always, they are the products of thoughtlessness, of leaders who avoid thinking about the culture and so lete it develop without guidance. There are no organizaiions without institutional habits. There are only places where they are deliberately designed, and places where they are created without forethought, so they often grow from rivalries or fear.

Sometimes, in the heat of a crisis, the right habits emerge.

"Much of firm behavior," they wrote, is best "understood as a reflection of general habits and strategic orientations coming from the firm's past" rather than "the result of a detailed survey of the remote twigs of the decision tree."

Routines and truces offer a type of rough organizational justice, and because of them, Nelson and Winter wrote, conflict within companies usually "follows largely predictable paths and stays within predictable bounds that are consistent with the ongoing routine… The usual amount of work gets done, reprimands and compliments are delivered with the usual frequency… Nobody is trying to steer the organizational ship into a sharp turn in the hope of throwing a rival overboard."

Creating successful organizations isn't just a matter of balancing authority. For an organization to work, leaders must cultivate habits that both create a real and balanced peace and, paradoxically, make it absolutely clear who's in charge.

All those leaders seized the possibilities created by a crisis. During turmoil, organizational habits become malleable enough to both assign responsibility and create a more equitable balance of power. Crises are so valuable, in fact, that sometimes it's worth stirring up a sense of looming catastrophe rather than letting it die down.

But once a sense of crisis gripped Rhode Island Hospital, everyone become more open to change.

these institutions have found that reform is usually possible only once a sense of crisis takes hold.

Good leaders seize crises to remake organizational habits.

Rather, wise executives seek out moments of crisis — or create the perception of crisis — and cultivate the sense that something must change, until everyone is finally ready to overhaul the patterns they live with each day.

### 7. How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do - When Companies Predict (and Manipulate) Habit

What they discovered was that despite those lists, more than 50 percent of purchasing decisions occurred at the moment a customer saw a product on the shelf, because, despite shoppers' best intentions, their habit were stronger than their written intentions.

Consumers sometimes act like creatures of habit, automatically repeating past behavior with little regard to current goals.

People's buying habits are more likely to change when they go through a major life event.

"Changing residence, getting married or divorced, losing or changing a job, having someone enter or leave the household," Andreasen wrote, are life changes that make consumers more "vulnerable to intervention by marketers."

There's almost no greater upheaval for most customers than the arrival of a child. As a result, new parents' habits are more flexible at that moment than at almost any other period in an adult's life.

So for companies, pregnant women are gold mines.

Listening to music activates numerous areas of the brain, including the auditory cortex, the thalamus, and the superior parietal cortex. These same areas are also associated with pattern recognition and helping the brain decide which inputs to pay attention to and which to ignore. The areas that process music, in other words, are designed to seek out patterns and look for familiarity. This makes sense. Music, after all, is complicated … Our brains crave familiarity in music because familiarity is how we manage to hear without becoming distracted by all the sound.

Our brains are designed to prefer auditory patterns that seem similar to what we've already heard.

By dressing something new in old clothes, and making the unfamiliar seem familiar.

Whether selling a new song, a new food, or a new crib, the lesson is the same: If you dress a new something in old habits, it's easier for the public to accept it.

People, it turns out, often go to the gym looking for a human connection, not a treadmill.

It's a variation of the lesson learned by Target and radio DJs: to sell a new habit — in this case exercise — wrap it in something that people already know and like, such as the instinct to go places where it's easy to make friends … "People want to visit places that satisfy their social needs. Getting people to exercise in groups makes it more likely they'll stick with a workout. You can change the health of the nation this way." … To market a new habit — be it groceries or aerobics — you must understand how to make the novel seem familiar.

## PART THREE The Habits of Societies

### 8. Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott - How Movements Happen

Social habits are why some initiatives become world-changing movements, while others fail to ignite.

A movement starts because of the social habits of friendship and the strong ties between close acquaintances. It grows because of the habits of a community, and the weak ties that hold neighborhoods and clans together. And it endures because a movement's leaders give participants new habits that create a fresh sense of identity and a feeling of ownership.

on the whole, our deepest relationships tend to be with people who look like us, earn about the same amount of money, and come from similar backgrounds.

Studies show that people have no problem ignoring strangers' injuries, but when a friend is insulted, our sense of outrage is enough to overcome the inertia that usually makes protests hard to organize.

Our weak-tie acquaintances are often as influential — if not more — than our close-tie friends.

Convincing thousands of people to pursue the same goal — especially when that pursuit entails real hardship, such as walking to work rather than taking the bus, or going to jail, or even skipping a morning cup of coffee because the company that sells it doesn't support organic farming — is hard.

People follow Christ not because you've led them there, but because it's who they are.

All of us are simply a bundle of habits.

**For an idea to grow beyond a community, it must become self-propelling. And the surest way to achieve that is to give people new habits that help them figure out where to go on their own.**

He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword.

Jesus still cries out in words that echo across the centuries: 'Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; pray for them that despitefully use you.'

"We must meet hate with love," King told the crowd the night of the bombing."If I am stopped, our work will not stop. For what we are doing is right. What we are doing is just. And God is with us."

Embedded within King's philosophy was a set of new behaviors that converted participants from followers into self-directing leaders … the protest became a movement fueled by  people who were acting because they had taken ownership of a historic event.

### 9. The Neurology of Free Will - Are We Responsible for Our Habits?

"Sleepwalking is a reminder that wake and sleep are not mutually exclusive," Mark Mahowald, a professor of neurology at the University of Minnesota and a pioneer in understanding sleep behaviors, told me."The part of your brain that monitors your behavior is asleep, but the parts capable of very complex activities are awake. The problem is that there's nothing guiding the brain except for basic patterns, your most basic habits. You follow what exits in your head, because you're not capable of making a choice."

**the neurological machinery of the habit loop**

To a neurologist, in fact, a brain experiencing a sleep terror looks very similar to a brain following a habit … The behaviors of people in the grip of sleep terrors are habits, though of the most primal kind … automatic behaviors so ingrained in our neurology that, studies show, they can occur with almost no input from the higher regions of the brain … Because sleep deactivates the prefrontal cortex and other high cognition areas, when a sleep terror habit is triggered, there is no possibility of conscious intervention.

Basal ganglia and the brain stem: the same regions where habits reside (as well as where behaviors related to sleep terrors start).

The behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves, he (Aristotle) said. So "just as a piece of land has to be prepared beforehand if it is to nourish the seed, so the miand of the pupil has to be prepared in its habits if it is to enjoy and dislike the right things." … habits — even once they are rooted in our minds — aren't destiny. We can choose our habits, once we know how. Everything we know about habits, from neurologists studying amnesiacs and organizational experts remaking companies, is that any of them can be changed, if you understand how they function … Hundreds of habits influence our days — they guide how we get dressed in the morning, talk to our kids, and fall asleep at night; they impact what we eat for lunch, how we do business, and whether we exercise or have a beer after work. Each of them has a different cue and offers a unique reward. Some are simple and others are complex, drawing upon emotional trigger and offering subtle neurochemical prizes. But every habit, no matter its complexity, is malleable. The most addicted alcoholics can become sober. The mos t dysfunctional companies can transform themselves. A high school dropout can became a successful manager … However, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and  rewards that drive the habits' routines, and find alternatives. You must know you have control and be self-conscious enough to use it.

And once you know a habit exist, you have the responsibility to change it.

Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left it to get work.

"All our life," William James told us in the prologue, "so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits — practical, emotional, and intellectual — systematically organized for our weal or woe, and bearing us irresisitibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be."

My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will.

Later, he would famously write that the will to believe is the most important ingredient in creating belief in change. And that one of the most important methods for creating that belief was habits. Habits, he noted, are what allow us to "do a thing with difficult the first time, but soon do it more and more easily, and finally, with sufficient practice, do it semi-mechanically, or with hardly any consciousness at all." Once we choose who we want to be, people grow "to the way in which they have been exercised, just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds."

If you believe you can change — if you make it a habit — the change becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be. Once that choose occurs — and becomes automatic — it's not only real, it starts to seem inevitable, the thing, as James wrote, that bears "us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be."

The way we habitually think of our surroundings and ourselves create the worlds that each of us inhabit. "There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says 'Morning, boys. How's the water?'" the writer David Foster Wallace told a class of graduating college students in 2005. "And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes 'What the hell is water?'"

The water is habits, the unthinking choices and invisible decisions that surround us every day — and which, just by looking at them, become visible again.

**a framework for understanding how habits work and a guide to experimenting with how they might change**

THE FRAMEWORK:

- Identify the routine
- Experiment with rewards
- Isolate the cue
- Have a plan

a habit is a choice that we deliberately make at some point, and then stop thinking about, but continue doing, often every day.

Put another way, a habit is a formula our brain automatically follows: When I see CUE, I will do ROUTINE in order to get a REWARD.
