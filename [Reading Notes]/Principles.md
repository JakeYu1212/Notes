# INTRODUCTION

Whatever success I've had in life has had more to do with my knowing how to deal with my ==*not*== knowing than anything I know.

My hope is that reading this book will prompt you and others to discover your own principles from wherever you think is best and ideally write them down.

Because we each have our own goals and our own natures, each of us must choose our own principles to match them.

<u>If you can think for yourself while being open-minded in a clearheaded way to find out what is best for you to do, and if you can summon up the courage to do it, you will make the most of your life.</u>

- ### Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2...

People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don't will suffer through constant misunderstandings and conflicts.

You will be faced with millions of choices in life, and the way you make them will reflect the principles you have.

making a lot of mistakes and spending a lot of time reflecting on them.

**key to success lines in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well.**

To make money in the markets, one needs to be an independent thinker who bets against the consensus and is right.

**To be a successful entrepreneur, the same is true: One also has to be an independent thinker who correctly bet against the consensus, which means being painfully wrong a fair amount.**

Experience taught me how invaluable it is to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria whenever I made a decision, so I got in the habit of doing that.

**a collection of recipes for decision making.**

The most important thing is that you develop your own principles and ideally ==write them down==, especially if you are working with others.

we are simply a group of people who are striving to be excellent at what we do and who recognize that we don't know much relative to what we need to know.

**We believe that thoughtful, unemotional disagreement by independent thinkers can be converted into believability-weighted decision making that is smarter and more effective than the sum of its parts.**

# PART I WHERE I'M COMING FROM

Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can't stop our movement down this river and we can't avoid those encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way.

## CHAPTER 1 MY CALL TO ADVENTURE: 1949-1976

I couldn't, and still can't, remember facts that don't have reasons for being what they are (like phone numbers), and I don't like following instructions.

==For me, great is better than terrible, and terrible is better than mediocre, because terrible at least gives life flavor.==

## CHAPTER 2 CROSSING THE THRESHOLD: 1967-1979

My college years coincided with the era of free love, mind-expanding drug experimentation, and rejection of traditional authority.

The times we lived in taught us both to question established ways of doing things---an attitude he demonstrated superbly in Apple's iconic "1984" and "Here's to the Crazy Ones", which were ad campaigns that spoke to me.

You better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you don't you won't know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won't know how to deal with them.

In trading you have to be defensive and aggressive at the same time. If you are not aggressive, you are not going to make money, and if you are not defensive, you are not going to keep money.

To me it all looked like a beautiful machine with logical cause-effect relationships. By understanding these relationships, I could come up with decision rules(or principles) I could model.

There are always risks out there that can hurt you badly, even in the seemingly safest bets. so it's always best to assume you're missing something.

While making money was good, having meaningful work and meaningful relationships war far better. To me, meaningful work is being on a mission I become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with people I care deeply about and who care deeply about me.

So, for me, meaningful work and meaningful relationships were and still are my primary goals and everything I did was for them. Making money was an incidental consequence of that.

## CHAPTER 3 MY ABYSS: 1979-1982

Timing is everything.

challenging each other's ideas and trying to find the best answers;

"How do I know I'm right?" And I saw clearly that the best way to answer this question is by finding other independent thinkers who are on the same mission as me and who see things differently from me. By engaging them in thoughtful disagreement, I'd be able to understand their reasoning and have them stress-test mine. That way, we can all raise our probability of being right.

In other words, I just want to be right --- I don't care if the right answer comes from me.

this experience led me to build Bridgewater as an idea meritocracy --- not an autocracy in which I lead and others follow, and not a democracy in which everyone's vote is equal --- but a meritocracy that encourages thoughtful disagreements and explores and weighs people's opinions in proportion to their merits.

I came to see that people's greatest weaknesses are the flip sides of their greatest strengths.

Most are too much one way and not enough another. Typically, by doing what comes naturally to us, we fail to account for our weakness, which leads us to crash. What happens after we crash is most important. Successful people change in ways that allow them to continue to take advantage of their strengths while compensating for their weakness and unsuccessful people don't.

beneficial change begins when you can acknowledge and even embrace your weakness.

"It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did."

I saw that to do exceptionally well you have to push your limits and that, if you push your limits, you will crash and it will hurt a lot. You will think you have failed --- but that won't be true unless you give up. Believe it or not, your pain will fade and you will have many other opportunities ahead of you, though you might not see them at the time. The most important thing you can do is to gather the lessons these failures provide and gain humility and radical open-mindedness in order to increase your chances of success. Then you press on.

I learned to go slowly when faced with the choice between two things that you need that are seemingly at odds...how to have as much of both as possible. There is almost always a good path that you just haven't discovered yet, so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent for you.

## CHAPTER 4 MY ROAD OF TRIALS: 1983-1994

I never thought of what I was doing as building (or rebuilding) a company; I was just getting the things I needed to play my game.

theoretically...if there was a computer that could hold all of the world's facts and if it was perfectly programmed mathematically expressly of the relationships between all of the world's parts, the future could be perfectly foretold.

"He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass"

Rather than argue about our conclusions, my partners and I would argue about our different decision-making criteria. Then we resolved our disagreements by testing the criteria objectively.

I believe one of the most valuable things you can do to improve your decision making is to think through your principles for making decisions, write them out in both words and computer algorithms, back-test them if possible, and use them on a real-time basis to run in parallel with your brain's decision making.

I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones.

I had always wanted to have --- and to be around people who also wanted to have --- a life full of meaningful work and meaningful relationships, and to me a meaningful relationship is one that's open and honest in a way that lets people be straight with each other.

All great investors and investment approaches have bad patches; losing faith in them at such times is as common a mistake as getting too enamored of them when they do well. Because most people are more emotional than logical, they tend to overreact to short-term results; they give up and sell low when times are bad and buy too high when times are good. I find this is just as true for relationships as it is for investments --- wise people stick with sound fundamentals through the ups and downs, while flighty people react emotionally to how things feel, jumping into things when they're hot and abandoning them when they're not.

because by reflecting on and learning from our poor performance, we made systematic improvements. I have come to realize that bad times coupled with good reflections provide some of the best lessons, and not just about business but also about relationships.

I got a lot out of my bad times, not just because they game mistakes to learn from but also because they helped me find out who my real friends were --- the friends who would be with me through thick and thin.

I didn't value experience as much as character, creativity, and common sense, which I suppose was related to my having started Bridgewater two years out of school myself, and my belief that ==having an ability to figure things out is more important than having specific knowledge of how to do something.==

Making a handful of good uncorrelated bets that are balanced and leveraged well is the surest way of having a lot of upside without being exposed to unacceptable downside.

What was great is that we made the most of our mistakes because we got in the habit of viewing them as opportunities to learn and improve.

I believed strongly that we should bring problems and disagreements to the surface to learn what should be done to make things better.

Having a process that ensures problems are brought to the surface, and their root causes diagnosed, assures that continual improvements occur.

This looked to me like another one of those fork-in-the-road cases in which I had to choose between one of two seemingly essential but mutually exclusive options: 1) being radically truthful with each other including probing to bring our problems and weaknesses to the surface so we could deal with them forthrightly and 2) having happy and satisfied employees. And it reminds me that when facing with the choice between two things you need that are seemingly at odds, go slowly to figure out how you can have as much of both as possible. There is almost always a good path that you just haven't figured out yet, so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent to you.

1. Put our honest thoughts out on the table,
2. Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift their opinions as they learn, and
3. Have agreed-upon ways of deciding(e.g., voting, having clear authorities) if disagreements remain so that we can move beyond them without resentments.

## CHAPTER 5 THE ULTIMATE BOON: 1995-2010

To me, the greatest success you can have as the person in charge is to orchestrate others to do things well without you.

We were both products of our environments. Investors think independently, anticipate things that haven't happened yet, and put real money at stake with their bets. Policymakers come from environments that nurture consensus, not dissent, that train them to react to things that have already occurred, and that prepare them for negotiations, not placing bets.

I've always had great faith in my ability to figure things out, and over time my need to figure things out made me better at doing so. As a result, I tended to hire people who were the same way --- who would dive right into challenges, figure out what to do about them, and then do it. I figured that if they had great character, common sense, and creativity, and were driven to achieve our shared mission, they would discover what it took to be successful if I gave them the freedom to figure out how to make the right decision... If I was the one telling them what to do, I wouldn't be getting any leverage from them. Besides, I didn't want to work with people who needed that.

It is the rare bird who has the right mix of common sense, creativity, and character to shape change.

People who run companies are faced with important choices every day. How they make those choices determines the character of the company, the quality of its relationships, and the outcomes it produces.

## CHAPTER 6 RETURNING THE BOON: 2011-2015

I do things through trial and error --- making mistakes, figuring out what I did wrong, coming up with new principles, and finally succeeding --- and I didn't see why my transition should be any different.

==A shaper is someone who comes up with unique and valuable visions and builds them out beautifully, typically over the doubts and opposition of others.==

a man who could visualize and execute in breathtakingly wonderful ways.

They had all visualized remarkable concepts and built organizations to actualize them, and done that repeatedly and over long periods of time.

==They are all independent thinkers who do not let anything or anyone stand in the way of achieving their audacious goals. They have very strong mental maps of how things should be done, and at the same time a willingness to test those mental maps in the world of reality and change the ways they do things to make them work better. They are extremely resilient, because their need to achieve what they envision is stronger than the pain they experience as they struggle to achieve it. Perhaps most interesting, they have a a wider range of vision than most people, either because they have that vision themselves or because they know how to get it from others who can see what they can't. All are able to see both big pictures and granular details (and levels in between) and synthesize the perspectives they gain at those different levels, whereas most people see just one or the other. They are simultaneously creative, systematic, and practical. They are assertive and open-minded at the same time. Above all, they are passionate about what they are doing, intolerant of people who work for them who aren't excellent at what they do, and want to have a big, beneficial impact on the world.==

The good habits come from thinking repeatedly in a principled way, like learning to speak a language. The good thinking comes from exploring the reasoning behind the principles.

"Unattainable goals appeal to heroes," he once told me."Capable people are those who sit there worrying about the future. The unwise are those who worry about nothing. If conflicts got resolved before they became acute, there wouldn't be any heroes."

A hero is someone who "found or achieved or [did] something beyond the normal range of achievement," and who "has given his life to something bigger than himself or other than himself."

our culture of striving for excellence in work and excellence in relationships by being radically truthful and radically transparent with each other. They recounted how we uniquely and repeatedly tried new things, failed, learned from our failures, improved, and tried again, doing that over and over in an upward spiral.

A community in which you always have the right and obligation to make sense of things and a process for working yourselves through disagreements --- i.e. a real, functioning idea meritocracy. I want you to think, no follow --- while recognizing that you can be wrong and that you have weaknesses --- and I want to help you get the most likely best answers, even you personally don't believe that they 're the best answers. I want to give you radical open-mindedness and an idea meritocracy that will take you from being trapped in your own heads to having access to the best minds in the world to help you make the best decisions for you and for our community. I want to help you all struggle well and evolve to get the most out of life.

## CHAPTER 7 MY LAST YEAR AND MY GREATEST CHALLENGE: 2016-2017

our modus operandi has always been to try, fail, diagnose, redesign, and try again.

I realized again that what I didn't know was much greater than what I did.

## CHAPTER 8 LOOKING BACK FROM A HIGHER LEVEL

When I was faced with types of situations I had encountered before, I drew on the principles I had learned for dealing with them. But when I ran into ones I hadn't seen before, I would be painfully surprised.

a healthy respect for history, a hunger to have a universal understanding or how reality works, and the desire to build timeless and universal principles for dealing with it.

I realized that reality was, if not perfect, at least what we are given to deal with, so that any problem or frustrations I had with it were more productively directed to dealing with them effectively than complaining about them. I came to understand that my encounters were tests of my character and creativity.

==Instead of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, I saw pain as nature's reminder that there is something important for me to learn. Encountering pains and figuring out the lessons they were trying to give me became sort of a game to me.==..the process of reflecting, developing principles, and then getting rewards for using those principles.

In time, I realize that the satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals, but from struggling well.

Since life brings both ups and downs, struggling well doesn't just make your ups better; it makes your downs less bad. I'm still struggling and I will until I die, because even if I try to avoid the struggles, they will find me.

Having the basics --- a good bed to sleep in, good relationships, good food, and good sex --- is most import, and those things don't get much better when you have a lot of money or much worse when you have less.

The marginal benefits of having more fall off pretty quickly.

I can say that being strong is better than being weak, and that struggling gives one strength.

What I have seen is that the happiest people discover their own nature and match their life to it.

# PART II LIFE PRINCIPLES

Reality, in turn, will send you loud signals about how well your principles are working by rewarding or punishing you, so you will learn to fine-tune them accordingly.

I suggest that you think through all the principles available to you from different sources and put together a collection of your own that you can turn to whenever reality sends "another one of those" your way.

## 1  Embrace Reality and Deal with it

By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually improves my decision making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in which the game gets harder and the stakes become ever greater.

All sorts of emotions come to me while I am playing and those emotions can either help me or hurt me. If I can reconcile my emotions with my logic and only act when they are aligned, I make better decisions.

Learning how reality works, visualizing the things I want to create, and then building them out it incredibly exciting to me.

I find it exhilarating being caught up in the feedback loop of rapid learning --- just as a surfer loves riding a wave, even though it sometimes leads to crashes.

But I keep that pain in perspective, knowing that I will get through these setbacks and that most of my learning will come from reflecting on them. Just as long-distance runners push through pain to experience the pleasure of "runner's high," I have largely gotten past the pain of my mistake making and instead enjoy the pleasure that comes with learning from it. I believe that with practice you can change your habits and experience the same "mistake learner's high."

### 1.1 Be a hyperrealist

Understanding, accepting, and working with reality is both practical and beautiful. I have become so much of a hyperrealist that I've learned to appreciate the beauty of all realities, even harsh ones, and have come to despise impractical idealism.

The pursuit of dreams is what gives life its flavor.

#### a. Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life.

People who achieve success and drive progress deeply understand the cause-effect relationships that govern reality and have principles for using them to get what they want.

Over time I learned that getting more out of life wasn't just a matter of working harder at it. It was much more a matter of working effectively, because working effectively could increase my capacity of hundreds of times.

### 1.2  Truth --- or, more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality --- is the essential foundation for any good outcome

### 1.3  Be radically open-minded and radically transparent

#### a. Radical open-mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change.

Learning is the product of a continuous real-time feedback loop in which we make decisions, see their outcomes, and improve our understanding of reality as a result.

The more open-minded you are, the less likely you are to deceive yourself --- and the more likely it is that others will give you honest feedback.

Knowing when not to make your own decisions is one of the most important skills you can develop.

#### b. Don't let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.

You must be willing to do things int the unique ways you think are best --- and to open-mindedly reflect on the feedback that comes inevitably as a result of being that way.

Learning to be radically transparent is like learning to speak in public: While it's initially awkward, the more you do ti, the more comfortable you will be with it.

Imagine how may fewer misunderstandings we would have and how much more efficient the world would be --- and how much closer we all would be to knowing what's true --- if instead of hiding what they think, people shared it openly.

#### c. Embracing radical truth and radical transparency will bring more meaningful work and more meaningful relationships.

### 1.4  Look to nature to learn how reality works.

While our higher-level thinking makes us unique among species, it can also make us uniquely confused.

In contrast with animals, most people struggle to reconcile their emotions and their instincts(which come from the animal parts of their brains) with their reasoning(which comes from parts of the brain more developed in humans). This struggle causes people to confuse what they want to be true with what actually is true.

#### a. Don't get hung up on your views of how things "should" be because you will miss out on learning how they really are.

It's important not to let our biases stand in the way of our objectivity. To get good results, we need to be analytical rather than emotional.

I now realize that nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual, but most people judge good and bad based only on how it affects them.

To me, nature seems to define good as what's good for the whole and optimizes for it, which is preferable.

#### b. To be "good" something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and contribute to the evolution of the whole; that is what is most rewarded.

#### c. Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing that is permanent and it drives everything.

While everything apparently dies or disappears in time, the truth is that it all just gets reconfigured in evolving forms.

For example, the primary purpose of every living thing is to act as a vessel for the DNA that evolves life through time...It is simply the process by which things either adapt and improve or die.

Evolution consists of adaptations/inventions that provide spurts of benefits that decline in value. That painful decline leads either to new adaptations and new inventions that bring new products, organization, and human capabilities to new and higher levels of development(as shown int the top diagram on the facing page); or decline and death, which looks like the diagram at bottom left.

perfection doesn't exist; it is a goal that fuels a never-ending process of adaptation.

Organisms, organizations, and individual people are always highly imperfect but capable of improving. So rather than getting stuck hiding our mistakes and pretending we're perfect, it makes sense to find our imperfections and deal with them.

#### d. Evolve or die.

The key is to fail, learn, and improve quickly.

### 1.5  Evolving is life's greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward.

evolution has produced a) incentives and interactions that lead to individuals pursuing their own interests and resulting in the advancement of the whole, b) the natural selection process, and c) rapid experimentation and adaptation.

#### a. The individual's incentives must be aligned with the group's goals.

#### b. Reality is optimizing for the whole --- not for you.

#### c. Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable.

#### d. Realize that you are simultaneously everything and nothing --- and decide what you want to be.

#### e. What you will be will depend on the perspective you have.

Where you go in life will depend on how you see things and who and what you feel connected to (your family, your community, your country, mankind, the whole ecosystem, everything). You will have to decide to what extent you will put the interests of others above your own, and which others you will choose to do so for.

My instinctual and intellectual goal is simply to evolve and contribute to evolution in some tiny way while I'm here and while I am what I am. At the same time, the things I love most --- my work and my relationships --- are what motivate me.

### 1.6  Understand nature's practical lessons.

I realized that most everything that at first seemed "bad" to me --- like rainy days, weaknesses, and even death --- was because I held preconceived notion of what I personally wanted. With time, I learned that my initial reaction was because I hadn't put whatever I was reacting to in the context of the fact that reality is built to optimize for the whole rather than for me.

#### a. Maximize your evolution.

The things are just the bait. Chasing after them forces us to evolve, and it is the evolution and not the rewards themselves that matters to us and to those around us. This means that for most people success is struggling and evolving as effectively as possible, i.e., learning rapidly about oneself and one's environment, and then changing to improve.

The law of diminishing returns: the marginal benefits of moving from a shortage to an abundance of anything decline.

If they are intellectually healthy, they will begin seeking something new or seeking new depths in something old --- and they will get stronger in the process. As Freud put it, "Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness."

The work doesn't necessarily have to be a job, though I believe it's generally better if it is a job. It can be any kind of long-term challenge that leads to personal improvement. As you might have guessed, I believe that the need to have meaningful work is connected to man's innate desire to improve. And relationships are the natural connections to others that make us relevant to each other and to society more broadly.

#### b. Remember "no pain, no gain."

While we don't like pain, everything that nature made has a purpose, so nature gave us pain for a purpose. So what is its purpose? It alerts us and helps direct us.

#### c. It is a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength one has to push one's limits, which is painful.

As Carl Jung put it, "Man needs difficulties. They are necessary for health."

### 1.7  Pain + Reflection = Progress

If you can develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it rather than avoid it, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving.

If you can reflect deeply about your problems, they almost always shrink or disappear, because you almost always find a better way of dealing with them than if you don't face them head-on.

If you can reflect well while you're in pain(which is probably too much to ask), great. But if you can remember to reflect after it passes, that's valuable too.

If you choose to push through this often painful process of personal evolution, you will naturally "ascend" to higher and higher levels.

The higher you ascend, the more effective you become at working with reality to shape outcomes toward your goals. What once seemed impossibly complex becomes simple.

#### a. Go to the pain rather than avoid it.

If you don't let up on yourself and instead become comfortable always operating with some level of pain, you will evolve at a faster pace.

Every time you confront something painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life --- you have the opportunity to choose ==healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.==

The irony is that if you choose the healthy route, the pain will soon turn into pleasure. The pain is the signal! Like switching from not exercising to exercising, developing the habit of embracing the pain and learning from it will "get you to the other side."

#### b. Embrace tough love.

If you can be open with your weakness it will make you freer and will help you deal with them better.

The quality of your life will depend on the choices you make at those painful moments. The faster one appropriately adapts, the better.

### 1.8  Weigh second- and third-order consequences.

This is because first-order consequences often have opposite desirabilities from second-order consequences, resulting in big mistakes in decision making.

Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and sometimes they are the barriers that stand in our way. It's almost as though nature sorts us by throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizing those who make their decisions on the basis of the first-order consequences alone.

By contrast, people who choose what they really want, and avoid the temptations and get over the pains that drive them away from what they really want, are much more likely to have successful lives.

### 1.9  Own your outcomes.

life gives you so many decisions to make and so many opportunities to recover from your mistakes.

but for the most part even the worst circumstances can be made better with the right approach.

Whatever circumstances life brings you, you will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complaining about things being beyond your control.

internal locus of control

Life doesn't give a damn about what you like. It's up to you to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it and then find the courage to carry it through.

### 1.10  Look at the machine from the higher level.

rise above your own and others' circumstances and objectively look down on them "higher-level thinking." Higher-level thinking gives you the ability to study and influence the cause-effect relationships at play in your life and use them to get the outcomes you want.

#### a. Think of yourself as a machine operating within a machine and know that you have the ability to alter your machines to produce better outcomes.

#### b. By comparing your outcomes with your goals, you can determine how to modify your machine.

#### c. Distinguish between you as the designer of your machine and you as a worker with your machine.

If you can recognize the differences between those roles and that it is much more important that you are a good designer/manager of your life than a good worker in it, you will be on the right path.

#### d. The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and other objectively, which leads them to bump into their own and others' weaknesses again and again.

#### e. Successful people are those who can go above themselves to see things objectively and manage those things to shape change.

They can take in the perspectives of others instead of being trapped in their own heads with their own biases. They are able to look objectively at what they are like --- their strengths and weaknesses --- and what others are like to put the right people in the right roles to achieve their goals. Once you understand how to do this you'll see that there's virtually nothing you can't accomplish.

Imagine all the areas in which Einstein was incompetent, and imagine how hard he struggled to excel even in the areas in which he was the best in the world.

Most of life's greatest opportunities come out of moments of struggle; it's up to you to make the most of these tests of creativity and character.

#### f. Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn't be doing.

#### g. Because it is difficult to see oneself objectively, you need to rely on the input of others and the whole body of evidence.

#### h. If you are open-minded enough and determined, you can get virtually anything you want.

At the same time, I urge you to reflect on whether what you are going after is consistent with your nature.

**SUMMARY:**

**1. Don't confuse what you wish were true with what is really true.**

**2. Don't worry about looking good --- worry instead about achieving your goals.**

**3. Don't overweight first-order consequences relative to second- and third-order ones.**

**4. Don't let pain stand in the way of progress.**

**5. Don't blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.**

## 2  Use the 5-Step Process to Get What You Want Out of Life

**1. Have clear goals.**

**2. Identify and don't tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals.**

**3. Accurate diagnose the problems to get at their root causes.**

**4. Design plans that will get you around them.**

**5. Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results.**

How you react to the pain that causes is up to you. If you want to react your goals, you must be calm and analytical so that you can accurately **diagnose** your problems, **design** a plan that will get you around them, and **do** what's necessary to push through to results.

It is essential that you approach this process in a clearheaded rational way, looking down on yourself from a higher level and being ruthlessly honest.

Mistakes are inevitable and it's important to recognize and accept this fact of life. The good news is that every mistake you make can teach you something, so there's no end to learning.

So what if you don't have all the skills you need to succeed? Don't worry about it because that's true for everyone. You just have to know when they are needed and where you can go to get them. With practice, you will eventually play this game with a calm unstoppable centeredness in the face of adversity. Your ability to get what you want will thrill you.

### 2.1  Have clear goals.

#### a. Prioritize: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can't have everything you want.

Choosing a goal often means rejecting some things you want in order to get other things that you want or need even more.

Don't get discouraged and don't let yourself be paralyzed by all the choices. You can have much more than what you need to be happy. Make your choice and get on with it.

#### b. Don't confuse goals with desires.

Typically, desires are first-order consequences.

#### c. Decide what you really want in life by reconciling your goals and your desires.

But what's key is what you do with your passion. Do you let it consume you and drive you to irrational acts, or do you harness it to motivate and drive you while you pursue your real goals?

What will ultimately fulfill you are things that feel right at both levels, as both desires and goals.

#### d. Don't mistake the trappings of success for success itself.

#### e. Never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable.

#### f. Remember that great expectations create great capabilities.

#### g. Almost nothing can stop you from succeeding if you have a) flexibility and b) self-accountability.

Flexibility is what allows you to accept what reality(or knowledgeable people) teaches you; self-accountability is essential because if you really believe that failing to achieve a goal is your personal failure, you will see your failing to achieve it as indicative that you haven't been creative or flexible or determined enough to do what is takes. And you will be that much more motivated to find the way.

#### h. Knowing how to deal well with your setbacks is as important as knowing how to move forward.

### 2.2  Identify and don't tolerate problems

#### a. View painful problems as potential improvements that are screaming at you.

#### b. Don't avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities that are unpleasant to look at.

Acknowledging your weaknesses is not the same as surrendering to them.

#### c. Be specific in identifying your problems.

#### d. Don't mistake a cause of a problem with the real problem.

#### e. Distinguish big problems from small ones.

You only have so much time and energy; make sure you are investing them in exploring the problems that, if fixed, will yield you the biggest returns.

#### f. Once you identify a problem, don't tolerate it.

You need to develop a fierce intolerance of badness of any kind, regardless of its severity.

### 2.3  Diagnose problems to get at their root causes.

#### a. Focus on the "what is" before deciding "what to do about it."

Strategic thinking requires both diagnosis and design.

determine the root causes.

Like principles, root causes manifest themselves over and over again in seemingly different situations.

#### b. Distinguish proximate causes from root causes.

#### c. Recognize that knowing what someone (including you) is like will tell you what you can expect from them.

what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don't is their willingness to look at themselves and others objectively and understand the root causes standing in their way.

### 2.4  Design a plan.

#### a. Go back before  you go forward.

#### b. Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine.

#### c. Remember that there are typically many paths to achieving your goals.

#### d. Think of your plan as being like a movie script in that you visualize who will do what through time.

You should go from the big picture and drill down to specific tasks and estimated time lines.

#### e. Write down your plan for everyone to see and to measure you progress against.

#### f. Recognize that it doesn't take a lot of time ti design a good plan.

Remember: Designing precedes doing!

### 2.5  Push through to completion.

#### a. Great planners who don't execute their plans go nowhere.

You need to push through and that requires self-discipline to follow your script. It's important to remember the connections between your tasks and the goals that they are meant to achieve.

#### b. Good work habits are vastly underrated.

#### c. Establish clear metrics to make certain that you are following your plan.

synthesize and shape well. The first three steps --- setting goals, identifying problems, and then diagnosing them --- are synthesizing (by which I mean knowing where you want to go and what's really going on). Designing solutions and making sure that the designs are implemented are shaping.

### 2.6  Remember that weakness don't matter if you find solutions.

have humility so you can get what you need from others!

Knowing what your weaknesses are and staring hard at them is the first step on the path to success.

#### a. Look at the patterns of your mistakes and identify at which step in the 5-Step Process you typically fail.

#### b. Everyone has at least one big thing that stands in the way of their success; find yours and deal with it.

While you and most people probably have more than one major impediment, if you can remove or get around that one really big one, you will hugely improve your life.

There are two paths to success: 1) to have what you need yourself or 2) to get it from others.

### 2.7  Understand your own and others' mental maps and humility.

Having both open-mindedness and good mental maps is most powerful of all.

once you understand what you're missing and gain open-mindedness that will allow you to get help from others, you'll see that there's virtually nothing you can't accomplish.

## 3  Be Radically Open-Minded

### 3.1 Recognize your two barriers.

The two biggest barriers to good decision making are ==your ego and your blind spots.==

#### a. Understand your ego barrier.

your subliminal defense mechanisms that make it hard for you to accept your mistakes and weaknesses.

Your deepest-seated needs and fears --- such as the need to be loved and the fear of losing love, the need to survive and the fear of not surviving, the need to be important and the fear of not mattering --- reside in primitive parts of your brain such as the amygdala, which are structures in your temporal lobe that process emotions. Because these areas of your brain are not accessible to your conscious awareness, it is virtually impossible for you to understand what they want and how they control you.

neocortex...prefrontal cortex. This is where you experience the conscious awareness of decision making (the so-called "executive function"), as well as the application of logic and reasoning.

#### b. Your two "you" fight to control you.

a) logical/conscious you

b) emotional/subconscious you

To be effective you must not let your need to be right be more important than your need to find out what's true.

If you are too proud of what you know or of how good you are at something you will learn less, make inferior decisions, and fall short of your potential.

#### c. Understand your blind spot barrier.

blind spots---areas where your way of thinking prevents you from seeing things accurately...we have different ranges for seeing and understanding things. We each see things in our own way.

Naturally, people can't appreciate what they can't see.

This closed-mindedness is terribly costly; it causes you to miss out on all sorts of wonderful possibilities and dangerous threats that other people might be showing you---and it blocks criticism that could be constructive and even lifesaving.

Aristotle defined tragedy as a terrible outcome arising from a person's fatal flaw---a flaw that, had it been fixed, instead would have led to a wonderful outcome. In my opinion, these two barriers---ego and blind spots---are the fatal flaws that keep intelligent, hardworking people from living up to their potential.

### 3.2 Practice radical open-mindedness.

Radical open-mindedness is motivated by the genuine worry that you might not be seeing your choices optimally.

replace your attachment to always being right with the joy of learning what's true.

#### a. Sincerely believe that you might not know the best possible path and recognize that your ability to deal well with "not knowing" is more important than whatever it is you do know.

Most people make bad decisions because they are so certain that they're right that they don't allow themselves to see the better alternatives that exist.

Radically open-minded people know that coming up with the right questions and asking other smart people what they think is as important as having all the answers.

They understand that you can't make a great decision without swimming for a while in a state of "not knowing." That is because what exists within the area of "not knowing" is so much greater and more exciting than anything any one of us know.

#### b. Recognize that decision making is a two-step process: First take in all the relevant information, then decide.

Most people are reluctant to take in information that is inconsistent with what they have already concluded.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Taking in others' perspectives in order to consider them in no way reduces your freedom to think independently and make your own decisions. It will just broaden your perspective as you make them.

#### c. Don't worry about looking good; worry about achieving your goal.

People interested in making the best possible decisions are rarely confident that they have the best answers. They recognize that they have weakness and blind spots, and they always seek to learn more so that they can get around them.

#### d. Realize that you can't put out without taking in.

#### e. Recognize that to gain the perspective that comes from seeing things through another's eyes, you must suspend judgement for a time --- only by empathizing can you properly evaluate another point of view.
