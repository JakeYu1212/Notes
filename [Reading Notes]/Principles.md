# INTRODUCTION

Whatever success I've had in life has had more to do with my knowing how to deal with my ==*not*== knowing than anything I know.

My hope is that reading this book will prompt you and others to discover your own principles from wherever you think is best and ideally write them down.

Because we each have our own goals and our own natures, each of us must choose our own principles to match them.

<u>If you can think for yourself while being open-minded in a clearheaded way to find out what is best for you to do, and if you can summon up the courage to do it, you will make the most of your life.</u>

- ### Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2...

People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don't will suffer through constant misunderstandings and conflicts.

You will be faced with millions of choices in life, and the way you make them will reflect the principles you have.

making a lot of mistakes and spending a lot of time reflecting on them.

**key to success lines in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well.**

To make money in the markets, one needs to be an independent thinker who bets against the consensus and is right.

**To be a successful entrepreneur, the same is true: One also has to be an independent thinker who correctly bet against the consensus, which means being painfully wrong a fair amount.**

Experience taught me how invaluable it is to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria whenever I made a decision, so I got in the habit of doing that.

**a collection of recipes for decision making.**

The most important thing is that you develop your own principles and ideally ==write them down==, especially if you are working with others.

we are simply a group of people who are striving to be excellent at what we do and who recognize that we don't know much relative to what we need to know.

**We believe that thoughtful, unemotional disagreement by independent thinkers can be converted into believability-weighted decision making that is smarter and more effective than the sum of its parts.**

# PART I WHERE I'M COMING FROM

Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can't stop our movement down this river and we can't avoid those encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way.

## CHAPTER 1 MY CALL TO ADVENTURE: 1949-1976

I couldn't, and still can't, remember facts that don't have reasons for being what they are (like phone numbers), and I don't like following instructions.

==For me, great is better than terrible, and terrible is better than mediocre, because terrible at least gives life flavor.==

## CHAPTER 2 CROSSING THE THRESHOLD: 1967-1979

My college years coincided with the era of free love, mind-expanding drug experimentation, and rejection of traditional authority.

The times we lived in taught us both to question established ways of doing things---an attitude he demonstrated superbly in Apple's iconic "1984" and "Here's to the Crazy Ones", which were ad campaigns that spoke to me.

You better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you don't you won't know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won't know how to deal with them.

In trading you have to be defensive and aggressive at the same time. If you are not aggressive, you are not going to make money, and if you are not defensive, you are not going to keep money.

To me it all looked like a beautiful machine with logical cause-effect relationships. By understanding these relationships, I could come up with decision rules(or principles) I could model.

There are always risks out there that can hurt you badly, even in the seemingly safest bets. so it's always best to assume you're missing something.

While making money was good, having meaningful work and meaningful relationships war far better. To me, meaningful work is being on a mission I become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with people I care deeply about and who care deeply about me.

So, for me, meaningful work and meaningful relationships were and still are my primary goals and everything I did was for them. Making money was an incidental consequence of that.

## CHAPTER 3 MY ABYSS: 1979-1982

Timing is everything.

challenging each other's ideas and trying to find the best answers;

"How do I know I'm right?" And I saw clearly that the best way to answer this question is by finding other independent thinkers who are on the same mission as me and who see things differently from me. By engaging them in thoughtful disagreement, I'd be able to understand their reasoning and have them stress-test mine. That way, we can all raise our probability of being right.

In other words, I just want to be right --- I don't care if the right answer comes from me.

this experience led me to build Bridgewater as an idea meritocracy --- not an autocracy in which I lead and others follow, and not a democracy in which everyone's vote is equal --- but a meritocracy that encourages thoughtful disagreements and explores and weighs people's opinions in proportion to their merits.

I came to see that people's greatest weaknesses are the flip sides of their greatest strengths.

Most are too much one way and not enough another. Typically, by doing what comes naturally to us, we fail to account for our weakness, which leads us to crash. What happens after we crash is most important. Successful people change in ways that allow them to continue to take advantage of their strengths while compensating for their weakness and unsuccessful people don't.

beneficial change begins when you can acknowledge and even embrace your weakness.

"It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did."

I saw that to do exceptionally well you have to push your limits and that, if you push your limits, you will crash and it will hurt a lot. You will think you have failed --- but that won't be true unless you give up. Believe it or not, your pain will fade and you will have many other opportunities ahead of you, though you might not see them at the time. The most important thing you can do is to gather the lessons these failures provide and gain humility and radical open-mindedness in order to increase your chances of success. Then you press on.

I learned to go slowly when faced with the choice between two things that you need that are seemingly at odds...how to have as much of both as possible. There is almost always a good path that you just haven't discovered yet, so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent for you.

## CHAPTER 4 MY ROAD OF TRIALS: 1983-1994

I never thought of what I was doing as building (or rebuilding) a company; I was just getting the things I needed to play my game.

theoretically...if there was a computer that could hold all of the world's facts and if it was perfectly programmed mathematically expressly of the relationships between all of the world's parts, the future could be perfectly foretold.

"He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass"

Rather than argue about our conclusions, my partners and I would argue about our different decision-making criteria. Then we resolved our disagreements by testing the criteria objectively.

I believe one of the most valuable things you can do to improve your decision making is to think through your principles for making decisions, write them out in both words and computer algorithms, back-test them if possible, and use them on a real-time basis to run in parallel with your brain's decision making.

I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones.

I had always wanted to have --- and to be around people who also wanted to have --- a life full of meaningful work and meaningful relationships, and to me a meaningful relationship is one that's open and honest in a way that lets people be straight with each other.

All great investors and investment approaches have bad patches; losing faith in them at such times is as common a mistake as getting too enamored of them when they do well. Because most people are more emotional than logical, they tend to overreact to short-term results; they give up and sell low when times are bad and buy too high when times are good. I find this is just as true for relationships as it is for investments --- wise people stick with sound fundamentals through the ups and downs, while flighty people react emotionally to how things feel, jumping into things when they're hot and abandoning them when they're not.
