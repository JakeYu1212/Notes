class="newline" />The unnamable is the eternally real.<br 
class="newline" />Naming is the origin<br

class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />Free from desire, you realise the mystery.<br 
class="newline" />Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.<br

class="newline" />Yet mystery and manifestations<br 
class="newline" />arise from the same source.<br

class="newline" />is like the bending of a bow.<br 
class="newline" />The top is bent downward;<br 
class="newline" />the bottom is bent up.<br 
class="newline" />It adjusts excess and deficiency<br 
class="newline" />so that there is perfect balance.<br 
class="newline" />It takes from what is too much<br 
class="newline" />and gives to what isn&#8217;t enough.<br 
class="newline" /><br 
class="newline" />Those who try to control,<br 
class="newline" />who use force to protect their power,<br 
class="newline" />go against the direction of the Tao.<br 
class="newline" />They take from those who don&#8217;t have enough<br 
class="newline" />and give to those who have far too much.<br

class="newline" />The Master can keep giving<br 
class="newline" />because there is no end to her wealth.<br 
class="newline" />She acts without expectation,<br 
class="newline" />succeeds without taking credit,<br 
class="newline" />and doesn&#8217;t think that she is better<br 
class="newline" />than anyone else.

class="newline" />is as soft and yielding as water.<br 
class="newline" />Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible,<br

class="newline" />The soft overcomes the hard;<br 
class="newline" />the gentle overcomes the rigid.<br 
class="newline" />Everyone knows this is true,<br

class="newline" />and corrects her own mistakes.<br 
class="newline" />She does what she needs to do<br
