### PROLOGUE The Habit Cure

"All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits," William James wrote in 1892. Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of well-considered decision making, but they're not. They're habits.

more than 40 percent of the actions people performed each day weren't actual decisions, but habits.
